# End-to-End MLOps Pipeline for Network Security Classification

This repository showcases a complete **end-to-end MLOps pipeline** for deploying machine learning models at scale. The project integrates **FastAPI**, **Docker**, **MLFlow**, **GitHub Actions**, and AWS services (**ECR**, **EC2**, and **ECS**) to create an automated and scalable workflow.

## Key Features

- **Model Lifecycle Automation**: From training to deployment, the ML lifecycle is fully automated.
- **Containerization with Docker**: Ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Implements robust Continuous Integration and Deployment pipelines.
- **Model Tracking with MLFlow**: Manages experiments, metrics, and model artifacts.
- **Cloud Deployment on AWS**: Deploys the application to AWS infrastructure for high availability and scalability.

## Overview
This setup serves as a scalable, reliable, and repeatable framework for deploying machine learning models in production environments.
